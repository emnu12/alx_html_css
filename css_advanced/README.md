# CSS Basic Project - Flexbox Layout

## Overview
This project is part of the HTML & CSS advanced exercises. The goal of this project is to practice **CSS layout techniques**, including Flexbox, responsive design, and styling enhancements.  

You will create a simple webpage with a **header**, **main content area** (article + aside), and a **footer**, using Flexbox for positioning and layout. Additional styling and responsiveness are included to make the webpage visually appealing and user-friendly across devices.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Positioning with Flexbox**
   - Implement Flexbox layout for `<body>` and `<main>` containers.
   - `<body>` is a column container with `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
   - `<main>` is a row container with `<article>` (2/3 width) and `<aside>` (1/3 width).
   - Ensure `<article>` and `<aside>` are scrollable if content overflows.

2. **Responsive Web Design**
   - Add `class="works_on_smartphone"` to `<body>` to enable responsive design.
   - Include the viewport meta tag for proper scaling on mobile devices.
   - Ensure the layout adapts nicely when viewed on smartphones or resized browser windows.

3. **Styling**
   - Add colors, backgrounds, borders, and font styling to make the page visually appealing.
   - Include a Unicode logo in the header.
   - Customize `<article>` content for a unique look without altering the Flexbox layout.

4. **Files**
   - `index.html` – Main HTML file with proper semantic structure.
   - `styles.css` – Contains all the CSS for layout, responsiveness, and styling.
   - `base.css` – Provided file with base styles.
   - `README.md` – This file, describing project objectives and instructions.
